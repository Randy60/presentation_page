        <h2>What is Python 3.0 (aka py3k) ?</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>Python 2.0s successor</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Python 3.0 was released in December 2008</li>
            <li>Hope was for implementation to take about 5 years (behind schedule)</li>
            <li>Current version is 3.5.1</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Intentionally not backwards compatible</li>
          <li>Python 3.0 is mostly the same, but there were enough changes to warrant a 3.0 version, not just a 2.x update. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Guido: We are mostly fixing well-known annoyances and warts, and removing a lot of old cruft.</li>

        <h2>Why Python 3.0? </h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>In general, a fresh slate to build-on and usher in this future of the language</li>
          <li>Implemnted to fix bugs and eliminate redundancies </li>
          <li>Python 3 changes unicode structure</li>
          <ul>
            <li>In both, there are two types of strings</li>
            <ul>
              <li>byte sequences using ASCII encoding</li>
              <li>Unicode strings</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Unicode > ASCII: more versatile and more used</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Unicode assigns a unique integer value to each character in every language</li>
              <ul><li>Allows characters from foreign languages, emojis, and the standard Roman letters and numerals</li></ul>
              <li>Python 2: Unicode not the default, have to mark with a “u”: </li>
              <li>Python 3: All strings are Unicode by default, need a “b” to make a byte sequence</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Which should you use? </h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>While we learned 2.7.1, it is argued that Python 3.x is easier for beginners to learn
</li>
          <li>Python 3.x, however, is the future of the language as they try to phase out v. 2.7.1 
</li>
          <li>Right now, really comes down to libraries. Newer libraries with various capabilities are only Python 3 compatible while others may be Python 2 compatible and not adjusted.

        <h2> 2.x vs 3.x </h2>
        <hr>
	<h3> Python 2.7 </h3>
        <ul>
	  <li> More widely implemented. </li>
	  <li> Better Documentation and support. </li>
	  <li> Strong community surrounding it that python 3.x does not have. </li>
	  <li> Performance speed is essentially equal </li>
	  <li> Integer Division 3/2 = 1	  :    3.0/2 = 1.5 </li> 
	  <li> It is the language people know and are used too and therefore see no need to change from it.</li>
        </ul>
	<h3> Python 3.0 </h3>
        <ul> 
	  <li> Not a strong backbone of users  </li>
	  <li>  Not much documentation and support  </li>
	   <li> Print ()  </li>
	   <li> Integer division 3/2 = 1.5  </li>
	   <li> All text is now Unicode  </li>
	   <li> Some small syntax changes but the two are very similar.  </li>
	   <li> Down the road will be more useful because it can handle more processes and is more powerful but for now people see no need to change.  </li>

        <h2> Implementation </h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
	  <li> Although Python 3.0 was released in 2008, Python 2.x continued to receive updates culminating with Python 2.7 which was released 2010. </li>

	  <li> Many 2.x users are not eager to switch, and 2.x is still the pre-installed language on both Mac and Lunix systems. </li>

	  <li> Python 2.x is the language of most current Python code, so switching to 3.x would be hard in an environment the user doesn’t control. </li>

	  <li> People don’t see a need to switch. </li>
        </ul>
